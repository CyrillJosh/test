    <h1 style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 60px; margin: 0%;">Beautiful Girls</h1>
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana; margin: 1px;">Song by Sean Kingston</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">You're way too beautiful girl<br>
        That's why it'll never work<br>
        You'll have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When you say it's over<br>
        Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
        They only wanna do you dirt<br>
        They'll have you suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When they say it's over<br><br>

        See it started at the park<br>
        Used to chill after dark<br>
        Oh when you took my heart<br>
        That's when we fell apart<br><br>

        'Cause we both thought<br>
        That love last forever (last forever)<br>
        They say we too young<br>
        To get ourselves sprung<br><br>
        
        Oh we didn't care<br>
        We made it very clear<br>
        And they also said<br>
        That we couldn't last together (last together)<br><br>

        See it's very defined<br>
        You're one of a kind<br>
        But you mash up my mind<br>
        You haffi get declined<br>
        Oh Lord<br>
        My baby is driving me crazy<br><br>

        You're way too beautiful girl<br>
        That's why it'll never work<br>
        You'll have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When you say it's over<br>
        Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
        They only wanna do you dirt<br>
        They'll have you suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When they say it's over<br><br>

        It was back in '99<br>
        Watching movies all the time<br>
        Oh when I went away<br>
        For doing my first crime<br><br>

        And I never thought<br>
        That we was gonna see each other (see each other)<br>
        And then I came out<br>
        Mommy moved me down South<br><br>

        Oh I'm with my girl<br>
        Who I thought was my world<br>
        It came out to be<br>
        That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)<br><br>

        See it's very defined<br>
        You're one of a kind<br>
        But you mash up my mind<br>
        You haffi get declined<br>
        Oh Lord<br>
        My baby is driving me crazy<br><br>

        You're way too beautiful girl<br>
        That's why it'll never work<br>
        You'll have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When you say it's over<br>
        Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
        They only wanna do you dirt<br>
        They'll have you suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When they say it's over<br><br>

        Now we're fussing<br>
        And now we're fighting<br>
        Please tell me why<br>
        I am feeling slighted<br>
        And I don't know<br>
        How to make it better (make it better)<br><br>

        You're dating other guys<br>
        You're telling me lies<br>
        Oh I can't believe<br>
        What I'm seeing with my eyes<br>
        I'm losing my mind<br>
        And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)<br><br>

        You're way too beautiful girl<br>
        That's why it'll never work<br>
        You'll have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
        When you say it's over<br>
        Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
        They only wanna do you dirt<br>
        They'll have you suicidal, suicidal, suicidal, suicidal</p>
